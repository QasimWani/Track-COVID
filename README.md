# Track-COVID
Automating the spread of COVID-19 by a 10-minute update crawler
#### This repository aims to collect the data involving the spread of COVID-19 in 10-minute intervals (cronjobs will update it hourly) and plot its growth accordingly.
##### Through this, we can further establish an ML model that predicts the spread of virus in a particular geolocation (to-do).
> Automatic Image Generation using in-built cronjob algorithms (node.js server, not in this repo currently). But plan to host it on a Raspberry Pi
